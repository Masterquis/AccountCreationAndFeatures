<h1>Active Directory Search, Advanced Features, and Account Creation</h1>

<!-- ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo) -->

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will demonstrate how to use active directory to Search for users when their user group is unknown and determine what group a user is a part of by enabling advanced features. It will also demonstrate how to enable "Recycling Bin" via Windows Administrator Center. It will demonstrate how to create a new user from scratch, it will also demonstrate more efficient user creation with appropriate roles and abilities already intact.

<br />
<br />
This will allow us to add a user the traditional way (We'll add a user a more efficient way a little later in the lab):  <br/>

<br />
When Searching for a user its important to Search the "Entire Directory" so we don't accidentally miss: <br/>

<br />
<br />
If we want to know what folder a user is a part of we can do this too. First, enable Advanced Features: <br/>

<br />
<br /> 
We know Advanced Features are enabled by looking at the updated navigation pane:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
By using the Object Tab when a user is found, we can see exactly where the account lives:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, lets setup the Recycling Bin, First we have to go to the Adminstrative Center:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once in the Administrative Center, we can Enable Recycling Bin.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We know the Recylng Bin is enabled when we can see an entry for "Deleted Objects":  <br/>

<br />
Next, setup a Helpdesk Super Account, but this time THE EASY WAY! First Copy the Admin Account:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We'll set it up as Helpdesk...:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Set the password, and make sure it never expires..:  <br/>

Finalize and Finish up the operation...:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We now have a Hepdesk account with Administrative Power. This can be done with any level of account easily and efficiently:  <br/>
